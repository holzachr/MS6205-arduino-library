# MS6205-arduino-library
An Arduino library for accessing the functions of an "Elektronika MS6205" vintage soviet multi-line character display with parallel data and address buses.
This library is currently tested with a NodeMCU v3 module, featuring the ESP8266 microcontroller.
It should work with other Arduinos as well, but is currently untested.

## ABOUT THE DISPLAY
The "Elektronika MS6205" display is a multi-line cold-cathode-tube display with internal high-voltage generation.
It has a visible area of 10 x 10 cm, and supports 160 characters in 10 rows with 16 characters each.
Parallel data and address busses are used to set the cursor position and the character to display there.
   
It runs of separate +5 V and +12 V supplies.
   
This library assumes that both the address and data bus are connected in parallel, where the data is
provided by the Arduino through a 74HC595 shift register.  
   
   
## SUPPORTED CHARACTERS
ASCII characters 32..127d are supported.                                                                                                     
Character codes 96-126 are assigned to cyrillic characters instead of `, lower latin chars and { | } ~.                                          
Code 127 defines a fully black box.

## CURSOR (optional)
MS6205 can show a black box at the cursor's current position.
If control line 8A is low, the cursor is hidden.
If control line 8A is high, a black box is shown.  
  
  
## PAGING (optional)
MS6205 supports up to 4 pages.                                                                            
Writing is always done to the current (visible) page. You cannot fill pages invisibly in background.      
After filling, the pages remain defined, until redefined, and can be selected randomly.                   
Pages are selected by inverted control lines 2A and 2B, which have pull-ups.                              
                                                                                                              
       2A  |  2B  | Page

      HIGH | LOW  | 2                                                                                         
      LOW  | LOW  | 3                                                                                         
                                                                                                              
1. Select a first page to write to                                                                  
2. Optionally clear it                                                                                    
3. Write to page                                                                                          
4. Select next page. Visible output changes, but page from steps 1-3 remains in MS6205 memory               
5. Optionally clear it                                                                                    
6. Write to next page                                                                                     
7. Now you can toggle between the two defined pages                                                       
8. Optionally repeat above steps to define more pages

## SIGNAL DESCRIPTION
  
A logical "0" (LOW) level is registered on address, data and other control lines at a voltage between -0.5 and 0.4 V.
A logical "1" (HIGH) level is registered on address, data and other control lines at a voltage between 2.4 and 5.5 V.
For this reason, control from a +3.3 V ESP8266 module works fine, even with the 74HC595 supplied with only +3.3 V.
    
The bits on data bus are inverted. So to write an 'F', send hex 0x39 instead of usually 0x46.
    
The lower bits 1-4 on address bus indicate the column (0-15), the upper bits 5-8 address the row (0-9).
